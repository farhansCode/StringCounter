# StringCounterProject
This project counts the number of times strings in file 1 occur in file 2.

It is written in the C programming language.

File input output, insertion sort and binary search have been implemented.

Clion was the IDE used.

# How to use:

Adjust file 1 to include the strings you want to count the occurances of in file 2.

Each string must be on seperate lines in both files.

Adjust file 2 to include the strings that will be compared with the strings in file 1.

Output will be printed to the council in the following format:

String : integer

for each string in file 1.
